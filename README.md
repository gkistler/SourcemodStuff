# Sourcemod plugins I've made over time

**L4D Competitive Stats**

Tracks and prints interesting round-based statistics for survivors and infected for L4D1.  Made by request and with the help of Philogl.  There are newer versions of this plugin floating around that support L4D2 and add more functionality.

**Tank Damage Announce**

The original tank damage announce plugin.  It's effectively Rotoblin's tank management/tracking with damage tracking and printing added on.

**Pistol Delayer**

A plugin to enforce delay timers on pistol fire rates, created in response to ProdigySim's tickrate unlocker.  The pistol fire-rate delays decay at a rate inversely proportional to the tickrate of the server, so for 100tick servers an unfair rate of fire became achievable without something like this plugin.

**Spec Gag**

Simple plugin to prevent MM1 from spectators in a L4D server.
